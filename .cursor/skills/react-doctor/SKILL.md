# React Doctor

Scans React codebases for security, performance, correctness, and architecture issues. Outputs a 0–100 health score.

## After making React code changes:

This repo’s SSOT is `pnpm react-doctor:changed` (`--scope changed --base origin/dev`). Do **not** run `npx react-doctor@latest --scope changed`: that defaults to `main` and will rescan the whole `dev` delta.

Commit already runs `pnpm react-doctor:staged` (staged files only).

If the score dropped, fix the regressions before committing.

## For general cleanup or code improvement:

Run `npx react-doctor@latest --verbose` (the default `--scope full`) to scan the full codebase. Fix issues by severity — errors first, then warnings.

## For a focused UI design audit:

Run `npx react-doctor@latest design --verbose`. This selects only design-tagged UI composition, typography, interaction, accessibility, and motion rules, including focused rules that remain opt-in during a general health scan.

## /doctor — full local triage workflow

When the user types `/doctor`, says "run react doctor", or asks for a full triage / cleanup pass (not just a regression check), fetch the canonical local-triage playbook and follow every step in it:

```bash
curl --fail --silent --show-error \
  --header 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  https://www.react.doctor/prompts/react-doctor-agent.md
```

The playbook is the single source of truth — a scan → filter → triage → fix → validate loop that edits the working tree directly (never commits, never opens PRs). Updating the prompt at its source updates every agent on its next fetch — no skill reinstall needed.

Pair it with the matching per-rule prompts at `https://www.react.doctor/prompts/rules/<plugin>/<rule>.md` (fetched on demand inside the playbook) so each fix uses the canonical, reviewer-tested recipe.

## Configuring or explaining rules

When the user wants to understand a rule, disagrees with one, or wants to disable / tune which rules run (not fix code), read [references/explain.md](references/explain.md) and follow it. Start with `npx react-doctor@latest rules explain <rule>`, then apply the narrowest control via `npx react-doctor@latest rules disable|set|category|ignore-tag …`, which edits your `doctor.config.*` (or `package.json#reactDoctor`).

## Command

```bash
pnpm react-doctor:changed
```
